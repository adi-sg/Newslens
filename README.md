# Newslens
#### This repo was originally a fork from @Griffintaur [News-At-Command-Line](https://github.com/Griffintaur/News-At-Command-Line)

### Newslens will help understand the news, specifically the bias presented across major news outlets and what is common vs. different in the way events are portrayed depending on the outlet.

# Current milestone:
- Writing the app in ruby (learning ruby for work)


# Modules Requirements

- **Python 2.7 +**
- **Requests** 
- **Beautiful Soup** 
- **PyYAML**

To install the module dependencies before running the application, simply navigate into the project folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

#### I recommend installing Python Anaconda so that all useful libraries are available at one go.
# Working
- All sample input images are placed under the **Images** folder.
- You can change the maximum number of posts in **config.yml**. Look for **Limit** attribute.

# How To Use
 Just run the Main.py. 
 You can understand the rest while using it for the first time.
 ### To execute
    python News/Main.py
 ### To install
    python setup.py install
    newsctl
